# Xeno-Canto-Mass-Species-Downloader
This code is used to download all the recordings of a list of specified species from Xeno-Canto.
You can change the species (and/or add species) downloaded by changing species names at the beginning of the code.
Make sure to change any relevant data in the code before running, such as the path which it will download to.
I used Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install) to run this code, which is how I recommend doing it.
